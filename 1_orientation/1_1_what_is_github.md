# 1.1 What is GitHub?

GitHub is a cloud-based service built on the Git version-control system that enables individuals and teams to host, track, and collaborate on code and data projects.

## The Foundation: Git

Before we dive into GitHub, let's understand Git:

- **Git** is a distributed version control system created in 2005 by Linus Torvalds (the creator of Linux)
- It tracks changes to files over time, allowing you to recall specific versions later
- Git maintains a complete history of who changed what and when
- It enables multiple people to work on the same project without overwriting each other's changes

## What GitHub Adds

GitHub takes Git and adds:

- **Cloud-based hosting** for your Git repositories (a repository or "repo" is a project folder tracked by Git)
- **Web interface** for viewing code, commit history, and managing projects
- **Collaboration tools** like Issues, Pull Requests, and code reviews
- **Access controls** to determine who can view or modify your code
- **Project management features** including wikis, task boards, and automation

## Why GitHub Matters for OSINT Work

For Open Source Intelligence professionals, GitHub provides:

1. **Record-keeping** - Every change is documented with timestamps and attribution
2. **Collaboration at scale** - Teams can work together on code and data sets
3. **Reproducibility** - Others can exactly reproduce your environment and results
4. **Knowledge preservation** - Work remains accessible even if team members leave
5. **Community** - Access to existing tools and ability to contribute improvements

## GitHub by the Numbers

- **100+ million** developers worldwide use GitHub
- **420+ million** repositories hosted
- Used by organizations from small startups to major governments and enterprises
- The world's largest collection of open source software and tools

## Public vs. Private Repositories

GitHub offers both:

- **Public repositories** - Visible to anyone on the internet (code, issues, wikis)
- **Private repositories** - Visible only to you and collaborators you invite

For OSINT work, you'll likely use a mix of both - public for sharing tools and techniques with the community, and private for sensitive investigations or internal tools.

## Beyond Code

While GitHub was designed primarily for software development, it's increasingly used for:

- Documentation and knowledge bases
- Data sets and analysis
- Policy documents
- Publishing websites
- Educational materials (like this course!)

Now that you understand what GitHub is, let's explore why developing coding skills is particularly valuable for OSINT professionals in the next section.
