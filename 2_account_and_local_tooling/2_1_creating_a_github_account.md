# 2.1 Creating a GitHub Account

This guide will walk you through the process of creating and setting up your GitHub account, which is the first step in your journey to becoming a technically proficient OSINT professional.

## Why You Need a GitHub Account

A GitHub account serves as your identity in the coding world and provides:

- A home for your code repositories
- A way to collaborate with other OSINT professionals
- Access to millions of open-source projects
- A platform to showcase your work and contributions

## Step-by-Step Account Creation

### 1. Navigate to GitHub

Open your browser and go to [https://github.com/signup](https://github.com/signup)

### 2. Enter Your Information

- Enter your email address (consider using a professional or work email)
- Create a strong password
- Choose a username that:
  - Is professional and recognizable
  - You won't mind being associated with your work
  - Ideally relates to your professional identity

> **Note**: Your username will be visible in your repository URLs and contributions, so choose wisely.

### 3. Verify Your Account

- Complete the email verification process
- GitHub will send a verification code to your email
- Enter the code on the signup page to continue

### 4. Select a Plan

- Choose the Free plan (sufficient for most OSINT work)
- You can always upgrade later if needed for private repositories

## Setting Up Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Two-factor authentication is critical for securing your GitHub account, especially when working with sensitive OSINT data.

### 1. Go to Security Settings

- Click on your profile picture in the top-right corner
- Select "Settings"
- Click on "Password and authentication" in the left sidebar

### 2. Enable 2FA

- Scroll to the "Two-factor authentication" section
- Click "Enable two-factor authentication"
- Choose your preferred 2FA method:
  - Authenticator app (recommended)
  - SMS authentication (less secure but easier)

### 3. Set Up Your Authentication App

If using an authenticator app (recommended):

- Download an authenticator app on your phone (like Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, or Authy)
- Scan the QR code displayed on GitHub with your app
- Enter the six-digit code from your app to verify

### 4. Save Recovery Codes

- GitHub will provide recovery codes
- Download or copy these codes and store them securely
- You'll need these if you lose access to your authentication device

> **Important**: Treat recovery codes like passwords. Store them in a secure location like a password manager.

## Personalizing Your Profile for OSINT Work

Your GitHub profile serves as your professional calling card in the OSINT and development community.

### 1. Add a Profile Picture

- Click on your profile picture in the top-right corner
- Select "Settings"
- Click on "Profile" in the left sidebar
- Upload a professional avatar (can be a photo or a professional logo)

### 2. Complete Your Profile Information

- Add your name (can be your real name or professional pseudonym)
- Include a bio that mentions your OSINT focus
- Add your location (optional - consider privacy implications)
- Include your professional email if you wish to be contacted

### 3. Create a Profile README

GitHub allows you to create a special repository that displays content on your profile page:

1. Create a new repository with the exact same name as your GitHub username
2. Initialize it with a README.md file
3. Edit the README to showcase:
   - Your OSINT interests and expertise
   - Tools you're familiar with
   - Projects you've worked on
   - Links to your other professional profiles or publications

Example Profile README content:
```markdown
# [Your Name] - OSINT Specialist

## About Me

- Network analysis and visualization
- [Other relevant skills]

## Current Projects
- [Project name]: Brief description
- [Project name]: Brief description

## Connect

```

### 4. Pin Important Repositories

Once you have repositories, you can pin up to six to your profile:

1. Go to your profile page by clicking your avatar and selecting "Your profile"
2. Click "Customize your pins"
3. Select repositories most relevant to your OSINT work

## Finding OSINT Communities on GitHub

Build your network by finding relevant communities:

1. Use the GitHub search bar to look for OSINT-related terms
2. Follow prominent OSINT developers and organizations
3. Star useful OSINT repositories to reference them later
4. Consider joining GitHub organizations focused on OSINT

Some OSINT-related GitHub organizations to explore:
- Open Source Intelligence Framework
- OSINT Curious Project
- Bellingcat
- Various security research teams
