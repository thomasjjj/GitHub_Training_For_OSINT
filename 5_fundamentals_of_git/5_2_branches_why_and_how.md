# 5.2 Branches: Why & How

Branches are one of Git's most powerful features, allowing you to work on different versions of your code in parallel. This lesson explains why branches are essential for safe development and shows you how to create and manage them both from the command line and in PyCharm.

## Why Use Branches?

Imagine you're developing an OSINT tool for social media analysis. It's working well, but you want to add a new feature to collect geographic data. If you start modifying your working code directly, you risk:

1. Breaking existing functionality
2. Creating a mess if you decide to abandon the feature
3. Making it difficult for teammates to review specific changes
4. Losing track of which changes relate to which features

Branches solve these problems by creating isolated environments for development work.

### The Benefits of Branching

Branches provide several key advantages:

1. **Safety**: Experiment without affecting the stable main codebase
2. **Organization**: Group related changes together
3. **Parallelization**: Work on multiple features simultaneously 
4. **Collaboration**: Allow multiple developers to work independently
5. **Review**: Make code reviews easier by focusing on specific changes
6. **Rollback**: Easily abandon changes if they don't work out

## Understanding Branch Structure

In Git, branches are simply pointers to specific commits. When visualized, a Git repository might look like this:

```
                  feature-branch
                       ↓
main: A --- B --- C --- D
                 ↑
            bug-fix-branch
```

In this diagram:
- `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D` are commits
- `main` is pointing to commit `C` (the primary branch)
- `feature-branch` is pointing to commit `D` (new work being done)
- `bug-fix-branch` is pointing to commit `B` (a different line of development)

As you make new commits on a branch, the pointer moves forward:

```
                  feature-branch
                       ↓
main: A --- B --- C --- D --- E
                 ↑
            bug-fix-branch
```

## Branch Naming Conventions

Adopt a consistent branch naming scheme for clarity:

- `feature/descriptive-name` - For new features
- `bugfix/issue-description` - For bug fixes
- `hotfix/critical-issue` - For urgent production fixes
- `research/target-platform` - For OSINT research tasks

Example: `feature/twitter-geo-data-collector`

## Creating Branches Using Git Command Line

### Viewing Existing Branches

Before creating a new branch, check what branches exist:

```bash
git branch
```

This will show all local branches, with an asterisk (*) next to your current branch:

```
* main
  old-feature
```

To see remote branches as well:

```bash
git branch -a
```

### Creating a New Branch

There are two main ways to create branches:

#### Method 1: Create a branch and stay on your current branch

```bash
git branch new-feature
```

This creates a new branch called `new-feature` but doesn't switch to it.

#### Method 2: Create a branch and switch to it immediately (recommended)

```bash
git checkout -b new-feature
```

This creates a new branch called `new-feature` and switches to it in one command.

In Git versions 2.23 and newer, you can also use:

```bash
git switch -c new-feature
```

### Switching Between Branches

To switch to an existing branch:

```bash
git checkout branch-name
```

Or with newer Git versions:

```bash
git switch branch-name
```

## Creating and Managing Branches in PyCharm

PyCharm offers an intuitive graphical interface for working with branches.

### Viewing Current Branch

Your current branch is displayed in the bottom-right corner of the PyCharm window, in the status bar:

![PyCharm Branch Indicator](https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2023.1/branch_indicator.png)

### Creating a New Branch in PyCharm

1. **Click on the branch name** in the status bar
2. **Select "New Branch"** from the menu
3. **Enter a branch name** in the dialog
4. **Click "Create"**

Alternatively, you can use the VCS menu:

1. **Go to "VCS" → "Git" → "Branches..."**
2. **Click "+ New Branch"**
3. **Enter a branch name**
4. **Click "Create"**

### Switching Branches in PyCharm

1. **Click on the branch name** in the status bar
2. **Select the branch** you want to switch to

For remote branches:
1. **Click on the branch name** in the status bar
2. **Select "Remote Branches"**
3. **Find and select** the remote branch
4. **Choose "Checkout"** when prompted

### Viewing Branch History in PyCharm

To see a visual representation of your branches:

1. **Go to "VCS" → "Git" → "Log"**
2. **View the graph** on the left side of the log window
3. **Check the "Show All Branches"** option to see all branches

## Common Branching Workflows for OSINT Projects

### 1. Feature Branch Workflow

The most common approach, especially for solo developers:

1. Create a branch for each new feature or investigation
2. Work on the branch until the feature is complete
3. Merge back to main when ready

### 2. GitHub Flow

Simplified workflow popular for web projects:

1. Create a branch from main
2. Make changes and commit to the branch
3. Open a pull request to initiate discussion
4. Merge to main once approved

### 3. GitFlow

More structured approach for larger teams:

1. Maintain two permanent branches: `main` and `develop`
2. Create feature branches from `develop`
3. Merge completed features into `develop`
4. Create release branches when ready to deploy
5. Merge release branches to both `main` and `develop`

### Recommended Approach for OSINT Professionals

For most OSINT work, a simple feature branch workflow is recommended:

1. Use `main` for stable, working code
2. Create separate branches for each investigation target or tool feature
3. Keep sensitive investigations in separate branches or repositories
4. Document branch purposes in your notes or README

## Branch Operations and Maintenance

### Deleting a Branch

Once you've merged your changes, you can delete the branch:

```bash
# Delete a local branch
git branch -d branch-name

# Force delete an unmerged branch
git branch -D branch-name

# Delete a remote branch
git push origin --delete branch-name
```

In PyCharm:
1. **Click on the branch name** in the status bar
2. **Right-click on the branch** you want to delete
3. **Select "Delete"**

### Merging vs. Rebasing

There are two main ways to integrate changes from one branch to another:

1. **Merging**: Creates a merge commit that ties branches together
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge feature-branch
   ```

2. **Rebasing**: Replays your branch's commits on top of the target branch
   ```bash
   git checkout feature-branch
   git rebase main
   ```

For beginners, merging is usually simpler and safer.

## Best Practices for OSINT Branch Management

1. **Create branches for specific purposes** - Each branch should have a clear goal
2. **Keep branches short-lived** - Merge or delete branches once their purpose is fulfilled
3. **Regularly update branches** from main to avoid drift
4. **Document branch purposes** in team communication
5. **Use consistent naming conventions** to communicate branch intent
6. **Review your own work** before merging
7. **Consider privacy implications** of branch names for sensitive investigations
